# Sample project to demonstrate Integration of Microsoft Application Insight with AEM

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* ui.apps: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests


## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with  

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
    
Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish
    
Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

## Testing

Following steps required to test the integration:

* Update InstrumentationKey in this file
    com.insights.sample.core.filters.AppInsightsTestFilter.java - Line # 65

* Check integration logs here- C:\Users\<usrid>\AppData\Local\Temp\app-insight-web-logs
* If no errors are found and connection is successful then you can see connection logs and telemetry requests in Microsoft Application Insights account.
